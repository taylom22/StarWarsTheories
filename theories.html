				<h3>Kylo and Luke's Master Plan</h3><br>

				Let me start by stating a few things we know.<br><br>

					<li>•	Ben Solo (Kylo Ren) was Luke’s star pupil</li><br><br>
					<li>•	Everyone knows (believes) that Kylo destroyed Luke’s new Jedi order</li><br><br>
					<li>•	Rey doesn’t know anything about her past. (as revealed in Before the Awakening) She remembers a ship leaving her behind on Jakku as a child, but doesn’t remember her family.</li><br><br>
					<li>•	Kylo is afraid Snoke will sense the light in him</li><br><br>
					<li>•	Kylo has force powers involving mind manipulation</li><br><br>
					<li>•	Harrison Ford wanted Han to be killed in RotJ</li><br><br><br><br>

				My theory is this: Luke starts his new Jedi Academy. He begins training many people to become Jedi. During this time, he feels a deep surge in the dark side of the force (Snoke’s uprising). Luke knows that he alone is not powerful enough to stop it, so he formulates a plan. He asks his star pupil and most trustworthy friends to help. Luke asks Ben to be a mole. He wants Kylo to do anything necessary to gain Snoke’s trust and become his right-hand man. </br></br>

				To help Ben gain Snoke’s trust, Luke and Ben stage the destruction of his Jedi order. They wipe the minds of all trainees in the new Jedi Academy and scatter them across the outer rim. Then they tell everyone that Ben was consumed by the dark side and destroyed the Jedi Order. Now Ben can attempt to become a mole.</br></br>

				The only people who know of this plan are Luke, Han, Ben, and possibly Leia. We’ll get to Han in a minute, but first I need to talk about Kylo’s “inner-light.”</br></br>

				You'll notice, Kylo struggles with succumbing fully to the Dark Side. The Dark Side is supposed to be the easy way to power. It's supposed to be difficult to resist. Why would he be worried about succumbing to the light unless the light within him is so strong?</br></br>

				During his duel with Finn and Rey, Kylo can be seen hitting his wound (from Chewie's bowcaster) to fuel his anger and make him more powerful in the dark side. He seems to be taking whatever shortcuts he can to fuel his pain and suffering. Like an emo kid, he wants to be dark and brooding, but hasn't had the hardship to back it up. </br></br>

				When Kylo is speaking to Vader’s helmet, he asks his grandfather to show him the Dark Side because he is “afraid that Snoke will see the light in him.” Why would he be afraid of that if he wasn’t truly good? If he truly wanted to fully submit to the Dark Side, would he not just ask Snoke for guidance? This must mean that he doesn’t want to dismiss the light, but merely hide it.</br></br>

				Han Solo’s story arch was weird upon first viewing TFA. In ANH, he is a selfish smuggler. In ESB he’s still that selfish smuggler, but he would do anything for his friends. In RotJ, Han is fully committed to the cause and would risk his life for the alliance. Had he died in RotJ, his story arch would have been perfect and complete. Even without his death, Han’s story arch is great. But TFA ruins it when we find out that Han has just gone back to being a smuggler. OR perhaps Han and Ben had a little Snape/Dumbledore action going on. </br></br>

				Han knew when he walked out onto the bridge that he wouldn’t be walking back. Also, Han seemed to be looking for a replacement, as if he knew that this would happen. He planned on Rey taking his spot alongside Chewy.  He made the ultimate sacrifice to ensure that Luke’s master plan could be carried out. This completes his story arch in the most satisfying way. </br></br>

				Kylo, on the other hand, struggles with killing his father. Both the movie and the novel demonstrate this very well, but in different ways. The novel says that killing his father made him weaker. Does this mean that he isn’t fueled by rage? In the film, we see the lighting change from blue (before the murder) to red (after the murder) illustrating how Kylo has concealed his inner-light (or possibly overcome it, if this theory isn’t true.)</br></br>

				After killing Han, in the novelization, Kylo feels "stunned by his own action." "Following through on the act," the narration says, "ought to have made him stronger, a part of him believed. Instead, he found himself weakened." </br></br>

				You might be wondering then… what about Kylo saying “I’ll finish what you started? If Vader is his grandfather, then surely he knows about Vader's last minute redemption. (In fact, the novelization confirms that both Snoke and Kylo know of Vader's sacrifice.) When Kylo says “I will finish what you started” Kylo wants to finish destroying evil. </br></br>

				Okay, so then, who is Rey? </br></br>

				Well… perhaps she’s nobody? Sort of… Many people will say that Rey <b>can’t</b> be no-one, because the writers left her past shrouded in so much mystery, which I completely agree with. However, this doesn’t mean that she <b>has</b> to be related to someone we know. There <b>will</b> be a big reveal about Rey’s past. However, it may or may not be in relation to her familial ties. Perhaps it will be revealed that she was previously trained as a Jedi and showed a lot of promise. Perhaps she was a prodigy of sorts, which would explain why Rey is a “Mary-Sue.” She has had formal training. </br></br>
				But perhaps the big reveal is this…</br></br>

				The Force Awakens is referring to the Force Awakening not only in Rey, but in hundreds of Jedi all across the galaxy. Episode IX will show us all the previously trained, newly awakened jedi coming together to fight the dark side. </br></br>

				Also, this explains my least favorite scene in TFA: when Han and Leia reunite and have the most awkward, unnatural conversation about their past. Movies usually don’t include these kind of scenes unless they're trying to dumb everything down for their audience. Han and Leia had an unrealistic conversation that people wouldn’t really have because they were describing, in detail, the past that they both knew. Not only did they both know all of this, but the audience had already learned all of this history by this point as well. “Why did we drift apart” “Because, remember how our son went all crazy and destroyed the jedi academy, turned all emo and joined the First Order?” “Oh yeah, I’m so sad that happened.” <b>What if…</b> (and I’ll admit, this is a pretty big “what if”) they were talking like that because they both knew what really happened, but they couldn’t say it out loud because they needed to keep the secret, and they both knew what was coming soon. (Han’s death) Just something to think about… </br></br>

			<h2>Snoke</h2>
				<div>
				<h3>Snoke = Plagueis?</h3><br>

				A lot of things in the film are nods, references, or recreations of things from Legends. <br><br>

				A popular theory (and one that I personally subscribe to) is that Supreme Leader Snoke is Darth Plagueis. <br><br>

				Let's get the weakest peace of evidence out of the way first. Check out this <a href="http://images.latinpost.com/data/images/full/65102/star-wars.jpg">picture</a>. Rey's staff is very similar to Plagueis' staff. (although, after watching the film, it appears as if she may have built it herself)<br><br>

				Also, note that Plagueis (in legends) is a tall and slender Muun. His staff, and his species/appearance are no longer canon. However, his appearanec in TFA is similar enough that it could definitely be a reimagining of the character. Also, Snoke's scars are reminiscent of the damage  sustained by Plagueis that forced him to wear a breathing apparatus. It should also be noted that <a href="http://nerdist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Daisy-Ridley-Dark-knight-II.jpeg">early concept art</a> for Snoke had him wearing said breathing apparatus. <br><br>

				Plagueis was Emperor Palpatine's master. (In canon) Palpatine also reveals that he killed Plagueis in his sleep. In Revenge of the Sith Emperor Palpatine also talks about how Plagueis was able to cheat death by creating, restoring, and retaining life. In the (now legends) novel, Plagueis is able to do these things as well as conceal his presence and create intricate illusions. You can watch Palpatine's tale of the Tragdy of Darth Plagueis the Wise here: <br><br>

				<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/05dT34hGRdg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

				Perhaps Plagueis (who was much more powerful and cunning than Palpatine) created an illusion to make Palpatine think he killed Plagueis. Plagueis, concealing his presence has been able to sit back and use Palpatine as a plot in his master plan to take over the galaxy. All the while influencing things behind the scenes. <br><br>

				In this time, Plagueis used the force to conceive Anakin Skywalker. The ultimate weapon, born of the force. Plagueis' original plan involved <br><br>

				1. Palpatine taking Anakin under his wing. <br><br>
				2. Anakin becoming more powerful than Palpatine. <br><br>
				3. Anakin killing Palpatine. <br><br>
				4. Plagueis revealing himself and partnering with Anakin (as equals, one being physical power and one being intellectual power) to rule the galaxy.
				(Or not, and just ruling the galaxy from behind the curtain because petty fame does not intrigue him like true power does.) <br><br>

				It should also be noted that in the (legends) novel, Plagueis' master Darth Tenebrous (as he was dying) told Plagueis that the rule of two was ancient poodoo mumbojumbo and it would hold him back. Tenebrous encouraged him to ditch the rule of two. <br><br>

				Another intersting tidbit to add to this theory comes from The Force Awakens novelazation. In the novelization, Snoke states that he has been working from the shadows for ages. He says that he has seen the rise and fall of the Empire. This isn't a lot of information, but it definitely supports the theory that Snoke = Plagueis. <br><br>

				Also, perhaps the strongest piece of evidence: check out this music comparison. <br><br>

			<h2>Rey</h2>
				<div>
				<h3>Rey's Family Tree</h3> <br>

					First, it should be noted that there are several things that happen in the film that point to Rey's lineage being of significance. <br><br>

					<b>1.</b> She says she is waiting for her family on Jakku. <br><br>
					<b>2.</b> Maz tells her that the belonging she is looking for (family) is not behind her, but in front of her. (In front, as in right in front of you? [Han & Leia] or as in, in the future? [Luke]) <br><br>
					<b>3.</b> Rey is obviously very strong with the force. Suggesting she has some Skywalker lineage (whether it's through Luke or Leia.) <br><br>
					<b>4.</b> Her flashback shows a connection to the lightsaber which was once Anakin's. Which could suggest familial ties to it. (whether through Luke or Leia) <br><br>
					<b>5.</b> When Maz asks Han "who's the girl?" The Camera cuts away suggesting that Han may know, but J.J. isn't ready to tell us. <br><br>
					<b>6.</b> When the First Order officer informs Kylo that they were unable to secure the BB-8 astromech, Kylo asks "Is there anything else I should know?" The officer replies "There was a girl." This is what sets Kylo off. Implying that Kylo may know who she is. Implying a past relationship (sister/cousin?) <br><br>
					<b>7.</b> TFA Producer, Kathleen Kennedy, George Lucas, and J.J. Abrhams have all said that Star Wars is the story of the Skywalker family. What would a story about the Skywalker family be without one of our main protagonists being a Skywalker? Then again, perhaps Kylo is filling the familiy role. <br><br>
					<b>8.</b> In the novelization, Kylo recognizes Rey. When she retrieves Luke's lightsaber with the Force to commence their duel, he mutters to himself, "It is you." This disturbs Rey, who observes to herself that Kylo "seemed to know more about her than she did about herself." <br><br>


					<br><br> <h3>Rey Skywalker</h3> <br>

					One of the most popular theories is that Rey is Luke Skywalker's daughter. There is a lot to support this.<br><br>

					Much like Luke, Rey grew up poor, on a desolate desert planet. <br><br>

					Rey definitely has a strong connection to the lightsaber that once belonged to Luke. When handing it to him in the final scene of TFA, they share a look tha indicates something big is about to happen. (A family reunion perhaps?) <br><br>

					Maz tells Rey there is no one coming back for her, but there is still someone who could. Rey then says "Luke." <br><br>

					<br><br> <h3>Rey Solo</h3> <br>

					Another popular theory is that Rey is the daughter of Han Solo and General Leia Organa-Solo. <br><br>

					That would explain Han Solo warming up to her so quick. (He doesn't do that often)<br><br>

					That would explain her and Han's simliarities (and finishing each other's lines on the Falcon.)<br><br>

					It would make Rey taking Han's place all the more poetic. <br><br>

					If my Kylo theory is right, then it would make sense that Kylo is trying to protect her (his sister) by leaving her isolated on a planet with her memory wiped. <br><br>

					It would explain Rey and Leia sharing a hug after Hans' death as opposed to Leia and Chewie sharing a hug. (He walks right past her. What the heck.)<br><br>

					But the one glaring hole in this theory is "why hasn't anyone told her yet?" <br><br>

					<br><br> <h3>Rey Kenobi</h3> <br>

					Before you cry "BUT BUT, his Jedi vows!" Remember, the Jedi Order was nonexistent by the end of Revenge of the Sith. When you consider this, combined with Obi-Wan's feelings for Satine Kryze, (TCW) pacifist leader of Mandalore, it is entirely possible that Obi-Wan had children sometime between the fall of the Jedi Order and his death in A New Hope. In fact, before the fall of the Jedi Order, Obi-Wan had told Satine he would leave the order for her. <br><br>

					In Rey's vision, you can hear Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness) call "Rey." Later in the vision, you hear (Obi-Wan) Ewan McGregor say "these are your first steps." Perhaps this is just paralleling Luke receiving the lightsaber, or perhaps it indicates a strong family connection with Obi-Wan. <br><br>

					They were both independent, loner, desert hermits for a long period of time. <br><br>

					Rey's fighting style matches Obi-Wan's. It is very defensive. If you think back to Obi-Wans' fighting style in ANH, he holds his saber in front of himself, kind of spinning it, waiting for an attack to block. In the Prequel trilogy, his fighting style relies heavily on blocking and countering with a reposte. <br><br>

					Watching Rey sneak around Starkiller base, climbing on things, reminded me a lot of old Ben Kenobi sneaking around to disable the tractor beams. <br><br>

					Due to Rey's age, she would have to be Obi-Wan's granddaughter. Perhaps, Obi-Wan had a daughter. Then Luke had Rey with Obi-Wans' daughter. This would make her the grandaughter of two great jedi. Mara Kenobi anyone?<br><br>

					<br><br> <h3>Rey No One</h3> <br>

					Perhaps she really is "no-one." It would be interesting to have more characters who aren't related to everyone, but I just don't see it happening, especially with how heavily her lineage is discussed and shrowded in mystery in The Force Awakens.
