		<h1>Dumb Theories</h1>

		<p>
			<div>
				<h3>Darth Jar Jar</h3><br>

				I'm not even going to give this theory the time of day.
			</div>

			<div>
				<h3>Darth Chewie</h3><br>

				When Han is killed, Chewie's life debt transfers to Han's son. Now Chewie is loyal to Kylo.<br><br>

				Chewie kills Luke to protect Kylo.
			</div>

			<div>
				<h3>Obi-Two Kenobi</h3><br>

				Obi-Wan Kenobi was actually Obi-One Kenobi, the template for a jedi clone army. We will soon find out that Luke has discovered this clone army on Rakata Prime.<br><br>

				We are introduced to our new hero Obi-Two Kenobi.
			</div>

			<div>
				<h3>Luke is Kylo Ren</h3><br>

				I mean, we've never seen them in the same room at the same time.<br><br>

				Adam Driver is just a red herring.
			</div>

			<div>
				<h3>Han Solo is a Jedi</h3><br>

				First: think about how comfortable Han was using Luke's lightsaber to slice a taun-taun like a christmas ham.<br><br>

				Now consider that Han Solo is the Obi-Wan of this trilogy (wise old mentor)<br><br>

				Now consider that Han may have let Kylo kill him as part of a master plan. The ultimate sacrifice. But perhaps, when he is stricken down, he becomes more powerful than anyone could have possibly imagined.<br><br>

				Luke was training him to be a secret jedi this whole time.<br><br>

				Harrison Ford will return as a force ghost in Episode 9. You heard it here first.

				<h3>MAJOR Legend of Korra SPOILERS AHEAD</h3><br>

				The original trilogy had one of the galaxies best love triangles. That is... until we found out two of them were related. How likely is it that we see another love triangle in this trilogy? <br><br>

				Rey, Finn and Poe are great characters, but they didn't get to interact much in TFA. In the future, I'm sure we'll see them interacting a lot more. <br><br>

				In the novelization of TFA, Rey actually meets Poe. The novel says that Rey "Looked at his face and realized she liked it." Therefore, I conclude that Rey has a crush on Poe. (Let's be honest, who doesn't?)<br><br>

				It should also be noted that Finn and Poe have quite the bromance going on. Will the trilogy pull a revised version of the ol' Korra switcheroo?<br><br>

				Let me explain: In Legend of Korra, we have three main characters: Korra, Bolin, and Makko. This is one heck of a cliche' love triangle. Korra likes both Bolin and Makko (who are brothers.) She REALLY liked Makko, but Makko was always too serious about other things to have time for her. Bolin was obsessed with Korra, and would drop everything for her, but she just didn't feel the spark with him. In comes Asami, and on the series finale' we find out that the love triangle is demolished by Korra and Asami's same-sex relationship. <br><br>

				Maybe Disney is going to take a note from Nickelodeon on this one. But they can't just introduce another character and have Rey be Bisexual/Homosexual, that'd be too similar. <br><br>

				I am suggesting that the love triangle will be dismantled by Finn and Poe's blossoming relationship. Everyone perpare yourself by shipping Finn and Poe, because it's going to happen. Disney can be progressive by supporting the gay community whilst also having a strong, independent woman who don't need no man.
