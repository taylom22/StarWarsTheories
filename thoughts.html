		<h1>Thoughts</h1>

		<p>
			I absolutely loved the film. It REALLY felt like Star Wars to me. Moreover, this movie felt more real than any other Star Wars I've seen. It's actually exploring real emotions and showing the human side of all characters. (Yes, even the aliens) <br> <br>

			The visuals were spot on. The cinematography was amazing, and the score was second to none. Spaceship battles were PERFECT. The lightsaber duel may be my new favorite one (or second behind ROTJ.) They were full of emotion and brutality. They were slow and realistic (as real as a lightsaber battle can be) but not awkward like the Obi-Wan/Vader duel. The characters were trying to kill each other instead of dancing around playing musical lightsabers.

			<br><br> Now that I've discussed what I loved about the film, I'd like to go into detail on the few issues I had.<br>

			<h3>Subtlety</h3>Most of all, the film lacked subtlety. Every reference was thrown in your face as if the film were saying "HEY did you see that sweet OT reference!?" Hopefully they got it out of their system so that the Ep: 8 can define the direction of this new trilogy and be its own series without using OT nostalgia as a crutch. I'll get back to subtlety in a moment. <br> <br>

			<h3>Family Reveal</h3> The "Kylo is Han's son" reveal was way to early and was essentially glossed over. It didn't have the impact it should have had. <br> <br>

			<h3>Star Wars for Dummies</h3> Back the subject of subtlety. They explained EVERYTHING as if the viewers were idiots. Long after we find out that Han is Kylo's father, there's a (far too lengthy) scene with Han and Leia that is extremely awkward filled with unrealistic dialogue. On top of being an unbelievable interaction... WE GET IT. KYLO IS YOUR ESTRANGED KID. <br> <br>

			Also, too little was left to mystery. That wretched Han and Leia scene spelled out the entire past in such a tacky way. (Lazy writing IMO. Once the film comes out, I want to make a fan-cut taking out all the explanatory dialogue.) Let us figure things out through events and context clues. Show us. Don't tell us. <br> <br>

			<h3>Where's the Mystery?</h3> I was kind of hoping Snoke would be left more mysterious. I mean, we still know very little about him (which makes me happy) but he got a lot of screen time. Compare that to the emperor who was little more than a legend in A New Hope. <br> <br>

			<h3>Awkward Stare</h3> I think the Luke scene would have been better left until Ep: 8. Also, that scene was just a little too long. <a href="http://imgur.com/Ay29K">Rewatch here.</a><br>
			Edit: I should say that I no longer think it should have been in Ep. 8. Despite the moment being a bit too long, I think it fits in really well. <br> <br>

			<h3>Anticipation</h3> The film left a lot of mystery as to "What's going to happen next." But it didn't leave enough (often more effective) mystery of "what just happened?" e.g. THE WALKING DEAD SPOILERS AHEAD: When Glen appears to be dead, but could be alive, there's a lot more anticipation to find out what happened relative to the anticipation to find out what's going to happen next when a zombie herd is coming toward camp. <br> <br>

			<h3>A New Hope 2.0</h3>There were a lot of parallels drawn to the OT. Most of them were very tasteful, but sometimes the fan service was a little overboard.<br><br>
			 The movie opens with Rebels being invaded by stormtroopers. Poe/Leia says 'Oh crap, here droid, take this important info and make sure the Rebels/Resistance gets it.' Vader/Ren shows up, captures Leia/Poe and interrogates them. Heroes visit a cantina of sorts to find help. Empire/First Order has a giant super weapon. Early on, they destroy a planet/planets to demonstrate its power. Droid/Finn gives Rebellion/Resistance plans and attack strategies are made to infiltrate and destroy super weapon. While on the super weapon, as the heroes are escaping, the wise old mentor Han/Obi Wan confronts and old friend/the villain and is slain as our hero watches. Heroes escape and our main hero is led toward a legendary Jedi Master in hiding on a desolate planet. Again, I hope they got the references out of their system so that this trilogy can begin writing its own story. <br> <br>

			 Edit: I feel as though I should Include this video for safe measure, because I do NOT think TFA is a "remake" <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pueu2wu0M5s&t=6s"></a><br> <br>

			<h3>Telegram for the Whole Audience!</h3>It was too predictable. But perhaps Star Wars is suffering from M Night Shyamalangadingdong syndrome. M Night made an awesome film with a huge twist. For that, he became famous. So... He started putting twists in every film he made. When you are expecting/looking for a twist it looses its emotional effect. Now, he suffers from delusions of grandeur and his films are unable to succeed because they lack the element of surprise. With Star Wars they can't recreate the big twist of ESB without being VERY CLEVER. So they're falling victim to predictable and clich√© plot devices. Or are they? I guess we'll have to wait until the tilogy is over to make that assessment.<br> <br>

			<h3>At least there wasn't a laughtrack...</h3>Also, I loved the comedy. It made the characters feel a little more relatable. Though there were a few times I think they went overboard. For the most part is was great though! <br> <br>

			<h3> Score 7 for JW!</h3>John Williams' score was fantastic, but nothing really jumped out at me as a new song for this trilogy. Edit: After my second viewing, Rey's theme, Kylo's theme and March of the Resistance really stood out.<br>
			Edit: You should definitely check out Rebel Force Radio's Oxygen Podcast analysis of the The Force Awakens score: <a href="http://www.rebelforceradio.com/shows/2015/12/30/star-wars-oxygen-vol-25-the-force-awakens-part-1"></a> <br> <br>

			<h3>We Need Transparency in Government!</h3>Most people hated how much the prequels talked of politics. But this one left you high and dry. I'm so confused about the political situation. The republic exists? Whose side are they on? What's happening here? Edit: Fortunately, this is all fleshed out a little more in the novelization. <br> <br>

			<h3>What's a Captain Phasma?</h3>I hope Captain Phasma gets fleshed out more in the future. Right now she's basically a Boba Fett without the intimidation factor. (Really cool design built to sell toys, but of little significance in the actual film) At least Boba Fett has a hinted past of being awesome e.g. Vader telling him "this time, no disintegrations." All we have of Phasma is her being taken hostage and doing what she's told. Edit: Phasma is fleshed out a little more in the books. She could end up being an excellent character. <br> <br>

			All in all, it felt like a safe reboot of ANH. Hopefully they take more risks in the future. <br> <br>

			Wow, I wrote a lot about the things I didn't like. I loved the film though!!! It's probably my third favorite Star Wars now. I can't wait to buy the soundtrack and give the score the attention it deserves. I was so busy focusing on every little thing in the film that I missed out on one of the best parts, the music! Edit: Now that the soundtrack is on Spotify, I've been listening to it a lot. It really is great. John Williams has done it again. <br> <br>

			Hopefully this trilogy pulls a Parks and Rec. In its first season it was good, but it was being held back by its desire to recapture the glory of The Office. Once it evolved into its own thing, it became one of the best shows on television. <br> <br>

			TL;DR : It was a great movie, and more importantly, it was a great Star Wars film. It has made me excited for what this trilogy could become if they grow out of fan service and OT worshiping. <br> <br>
